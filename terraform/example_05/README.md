Please Note:  This example is not meant to be the full and complete code stack needed to launch a web farm in AWS.

This portion of the terraform presentation code  only contains an example of the parameters that would be passed to a web-farm module, to demonstrate the efficiencies of using Terraform to create standardized deployment templates.
